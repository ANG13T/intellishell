## Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the directory to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ANG13T/intellishell
cd intellishell
```

#### 2. Configuring YAML Variables
Open the `config.yaml` file and configure the following variables:
```yaml
openai_api_key: "your_openai_api_key"
log_dir: "path/to/log/directory"
session_catalog: "path/to/session_catalog.csv"
prompt: "You are a programmer and UNIX system and terminal master. You understand every command emmaculately and can articulate what terminal commands do at a high and concise level. Do not use any redundancy in how you speak. Be clear and straight to the point. You have a keen perception for ANSI escape codes."
```

You can generate an OpenAI API key by visiting the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) page.

`log_dir` is the directory where the terminal sessions will be saved.

For `session_catalog`, you MUST generate a session_catalog.csv file. This file will be used to store the terminal sessions.

You can change the `prompt` variable to any prompt you want to use for the GPT model to analyze the session.

#### 3. Make the Script Executable:
```
chmod +x intellishell
```

#### 4. Configure the Path
Add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` path file:
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/intellishell
```

## Usage
Once you have the path configured, you can run the tool:
```
intellishell
```
